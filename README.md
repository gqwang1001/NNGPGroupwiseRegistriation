# NNGPGroupwiseRegistriation

This project provides code for the paper `Improved fMRI-based Pain Prediction using Bayesian Group-wise Functional Registration`

Please make sure that the supporting functions in `\supportFunctions`, `\2dsupportFunctions`, and `\RBF` are added to the path.

The `data` folder provides data in the one-dimensional simulation setting. The data in the two-dimensional setting was provided by the MNIST dataset which is embedded in MATLAB.

`run_1d_v1.m` and `run_2d_v1.m` provide code for both simulation settings.
